## Download

You can download it directly from here, but the file doesn't contain the Slack token nor the Google API key (config.py).

You can download it from the command prompt (as it is on Pypi and the token has been kept \* ) :
```
> pip install ...
```

This is a school project and the bot is far from being perfect, it sure needs some refactor and further improvement.
